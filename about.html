        <span class="title-name">Message from the Founders:</span>
        <p>I arrived in Beijing, China in the winter of 2010 fresh of a coaching assignment at Brandon University. I was excited to teach in China for one semester, return home to teach and coach, and regale everyone with tales of the Middle Kingdom or “Zhong Guo”. What happened is a different story.</p>

        <p>As I sit and write today, my life is very different than imagined. I moved from Beijing to Wuxi, Wuxi to Suzhou, Suzhou to Wujiang, and Wujiang to where I am today: Shanghai. My goals were never to teach this long, in a classroom anyway. I intended to get back to Canada and resume my coaching career immediately. Instead, I saw student-athletes unable to add the hyphen as easily as a child in North America or Europe.</p>

        <p>Chinese families are strict on education and rightfully so. Education represents not only the child's future but the future of the family name. It is in this spirit that families often forgo opportunities in basketball to focus on education. Long hours of study in the hopes of doing well enough on exams to be accepted into not only the countries top educational institutions, but the worlds.</p>

        <p>Herein lies a cultural difference between the East and West that is as obvious as the implements we use to eat. The current value of sport is the health of the body, not the health of the mind. Chinese culture doesn’t support the idea of sport enriching the child's academic life and insists that the more the child studies, the more successful they will be. In fact, the Chinese still say tóu nao jian dān sì zhī fā dá which means “all brawn no brains” or strong body weak mind.</p>

        <p>I see all of this as an opportunity as the sport grows in the worlds most populous country. We want our athletes to be provided with the same opportunities as others around the world. We created Alien Basketball Club as an opportunity for students to be student-athletes and to get a world-class education in basketball without forgoing the education in their current institution. We provide coaches like myself, who are teachers first. We provide education on the benefits of exercise to the mind and body and the science behind improved test scores in correlation to education. We provide cultural trips around the world to compete with and against the best players at each age level. In four years at Sino Canada High School, one served as Assistant Coach, three as Head Coach, we saw a drastic increase in graduation rate among basketball players while winning a BCOS Championship and a SYAC Championship. I intend to continue to do the same for ABC athletes. It’s why I do what I do.</p>
